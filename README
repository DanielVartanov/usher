Usher (let me show you to your request)

this is a tree-based router (based on Ilya Grigorik suggestion). Turns out looking up in a hash and following a tree is faster than krauter's massive regex
appraoch, so why not?

still very much a WIP, but supports named routes. still needs route globbing, but should be easy and fast.

looks about 20% faster than rails's built-in router for non-trivial cases. still need to investigate this massively.
