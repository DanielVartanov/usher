# Main class for routing.
# If you're going to be routing for a specific context, like rails or rack, you probably want to use an interface. Otherwise, this
# is the main class that actually does all the work.
# @example
#     u = Usher.new
#     u.add_route('one/two').to(:one)
#     u.add_route('two/three').to(:two)
#     u.add_route('two/:variable').to(:variable)
#     u.recognize_path('one/two').destination
#     ==> :one
#     u.recognize_path('two/whatwasthat').params_as_hash
#     ==> {:variable => 'whatwasthat'}

  # @option options [nil or Generator] :generator (nil) Take a look at `Usher::Util::Generators for examples.`.
  # @option options [Boolean] :ignore_trailing_delimiters (false) Ignore trailing delimiters in recognizing paths.
  # @option options [Boolean] :consider_destination_keys (false) When generating, and using hash destinations, you can have Usher use the destination hash to match incoming params.
  # @option options [Boolean] :detailed_failure (false) When a route fails to match, return a {Node::FailedResponse} instead of a `nil`
  #   Example, you create a route with a destination of :controller => 'test', :action => 'action'. If you made a call to generator with :controller => 'test', 
  #   :action => 'action', it would pick that route to use for generation.
  # @option options [Boolean] :allow_identical_variable_names (true) When adding routes, allow identical variable names to be used.

  # Attaches a `route` to a `name`

    route
  end

  # Creates a route from `path` and `options`
  # @param [String] path
  #
  #   A path consists a mix of dynamic and static parts delimited by `/`
  #   ## Dynamic
  #   Dynamic parts are prefixed with either :, *.  :variable matches only one part of the path, whereas *variable can match one or
  #   more parts.
  # 
  #   ### Example
  #   `/path/:variable/path` would match
  #   
  #    *  `/path/test/path`
  #    *  `/path/something_else/path`
  #    *  `/path/one_more/path`
  # 
  #   In the above examples, 'test', 'something_else' and 'one_more' respectively would be bound to the key `:variable`.
  #   However, `/path/test/one_more/path` would not be matched.
  # 
  #   ### example
  #   `/path/*variable/path` would match
  # 
  #    *  `/path/one/two/three/path`
  #    *  `/path/four/five/path` 
  # 
  #   In the above examples, `['one', 'two', 'three']` and `['four', 'five']` respectively would be bound to the key `:variable`.
  # 
  #   As well, variables can have a regex matcher.
  # 
  #   ### Example
  #   `/product/{:id,\d+}` would match
  # 
  #   *  `/product/123`
  #   *  `/product/4521`
  # 
  #   But not
  # 
  #   *  `/product/AE-35`
  # 
  #   As well, the same logic applies for * variables as well, where only parts matchable by the supplied regex will
  #   actually be bound to the variable
  # 
  #   Variables can also have a greedy regex matcher. These matchers ignore all delimiters, and continue matching for as long as much as their
  #   regex allows.
  # 
  #   ### Example
  #   `/product/{!id,hello/world|hello}` would match
  # 
  #   *  `/product/hello/world`
  #   *  `/product/hello`
  # 
  #   ## Static
  # 
  #   Static parts of literal character sequences. For instance, `/path/something.html` would match only the same path.
  #   As well, static parts can have a regex pattern in them as well, such as `/path/something.{html|xml}` which would match only
  #   `/path/something.html` and `/path/something.xml`
  # 
  #   ## Optional sections
  # 
  #   Sections of a route can be marked as optional by surrounding it with brackets. For instance, in the above static example, `/path/something(.html)` would match both `/path/something` and `/path/something.html`.
  # 
  #   ## One and only one sections
  # 
  #   Sections of a route can be marked as "one and only one" by surrounding it with brackets and separating parts of the route with pipes.
  #   For instance, the path, `/path/something(.xml|.html)` would only match `/path/something.xml` and
  #   `/path/something.html`. Generally its more efficent to use one and only sections over using regex.
  #   
  # @param [Hash] options
  #   Any other key is interpreted as a requirement for the variable of its name.
  # @option options [Object] :requirements After transformation, tests the condition using ===. If it returns false, it raises an {ValidationException}
  # @option options [String, Regexp] :conditions Accepts any of the `request_methods` specificied in the construction of Usher. This can be either a `String` or a regular expression.
  # @option options [Hash<Symbol, String>] :default_values Provides values for variables in your route for generation. If you're using URL generation, then any values supplied here that aren't included in your path will be appended to the query string.
  # @option options [Number] :priority If there are two routes which equally match, the route with the highest priority will match first.
  # @return [Route] The route added
